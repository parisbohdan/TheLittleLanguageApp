The Little Language App

A language learning journey app starting from no knowledge and working up through various exercises gaining XP and acheivements (aiming to start with Spanish going to A1-A2-B1-B2-C1-C2 level then moving to other languages)
They say the best way of learning is teaching and after that it is all about engagement.
This project will remain free as long as there are no issues with any licences. Images may have to be taken from the web.
This project will aim to have at least 5 pictures representing each image.
After the initial page, all of the instructions will be in Spanish for the immersion.

For maximum learning it will cover reading, listening, writing and speaking in that order.
Through the SRS (Spaced Repetetion System) of learning an incorrect answer sets it back to 0 days of wait to see and every time you get the correct answer you add 1 day to the wait.
So the first time you see it and get it correct you will have to wait tommorow, then get it correct and 2 days, then 3 days, then 4 days.

The activities will include:
a. Selecting the correct word from 9 given image (reading)
b. Selecting the correct image from 9 given text (reading)
c. Selecting the correct image from 9 given audio (listening)
d. Selecting the correct audio from 9 given image (listening)
e. Writing the correct name/phrase given an image (writing)
f. Writing the correct name/phrase given an audio (writing)
g. Speaking the correct phrase/name given an image (speaking)
h. Speaking the correct phrase/name given an audio with text (Speaking)
g. Answer some questions by writing the answer.


Audio has so far been obtained from Forvo.com

(Idea: Sell badges to fund the project, schools could love this)
